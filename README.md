# VSCode Settings

These are my personal **Visual Studio Code settings** to make your editor clean, fast, and visually appealing.  
This `settings.json` focuses on:

- Minimal distractions  
- Smooth coding experience  
- Improved typography and readability  
- Efficient workspace navigation  

> Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (just copy the file to your VSCode User settings folder).
